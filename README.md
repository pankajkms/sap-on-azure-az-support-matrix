Repository contains a quick reference of high availability and Azure AZ support matrix for SAP on Azure components.

All information contained in the support matrix have been referenced from standard Azure documents and SAP notes. As the official documents get refreshed with new updates,
it is highly recommended to refer the official documents for the latest information.

The information shared is for a quick reference. Errors or omissions are not intentional. Opinions are my own and not endorsed by any organization.
